Hello Jason,  This was my flash drive. Only my own files are on it. I tested the USB restriction. I didn't copy or open anything.  I've run a scan on your request, you can see the result below (0 risk found).  I am a member of the local IT team.  Thank you for your feedback, I hope I clarified the situation.  Best Regards,  Korek, György IT Trainee ___________________________________________________ AstraZeneca Hungary Alíz utca 4.
